/**
 * @file analytics.svelte.ts
 * @brief Thin, privacy-conscious wrapper around Google Analytics (gtag.js).
 *
 * The gtag.js script and GA4 config are loaded in `index.html`. This store is
 * the single place the app emits custom events, so every call site stays a
 * one-liner and the `window.gtag` guard lives in exactly one location.
 *
 * Transparency: the events sent here describe gameplay only — which screens are
 * visited, lobby/match lifecycle, the rules a match was started with, and
 * coarse error/disconnect signals. No message content, card values, chat, or
 * personal data is collected. This data is used ONLY for game research
 * (understanding which rules and flows players use) to guide development.
