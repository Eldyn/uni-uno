# Releasing UNI

UNI versions live in the `VERSION` file at the repo root and follow
[Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/). Pre-release builds use a SemVer
suffix, e.g. `0.2.0-rc.1` or `0.2.0-beta.2`.

`VERSION` is the single source of truth:

- **Backend** — `CMakeLists.txt` reads it into the CMake project version (the
  pre-release suffix is stripped automatically for `project(VERSION)`).
- **Frontend** — `vite.config.js` injects the full string (suffix included) as
  `__APP_VERSION__`, shown in the version badge.

## Cutting a release

1. **Bump `VERSION`.** Edit the single line (e.g. `0.2.0`). Use a `-rc.N` /
   `-beta.N` suffix for pre-releases.
2. **Verify the build.** Backend: `cmake --build --preset release`. Frontend:
   `cd frontend && npm run build`. Both must be clean.
3. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`.** Add a `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section curated
   into Added / Changed / Fixed (and Removed / Deprecated / Security as needed)
   from the commits since the previous tag, and add the matching compare link at
   the bottom of the file.
4. **Commit.** `git commit -m "release: 0.2.0"` (subject only).
5. **Tag.** `git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "v0.2.0"` — note the leading `v` on the tag,
   matching the existing convention; the `VERSION` file itself has no `v`.
6. **Push.** `git push && git push --tags`.
7. **Write the GitHub Release.** Create a release from the tag, pasting the
   matching `CHANGELOG.md` section as the body. GitHub auto-links commit hashes
   and PR numbers, so fixes can also be referenced inline by short hash (e.g.
   `db22aec`) or `#PR`.

## The changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` at the repo root is the canonical, in-repo history, following
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). It is the source the
in-app changelog viewer reads, so keep it accurate and parseable: one `##
[X.Y.Z] - DATE` heading per release, `###` section headings, and `-` bullets.
To point at a specific fix, use its short commit hash (`git log --oneline` to
find it) — GitHub renders it as a link inside release notes, issues, and PRs.
