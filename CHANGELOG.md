# Changelog

All notable changes to UNI are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The
`VERSION` file at the repo root is the single source of truth for the current
version; each release below corresponds to a `vX.Y.Z` git tag.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Renamed the sitemap to `sitemap-index.xml` (and repointed `robots.txt`) to
  recover from a stale Google Search Console fetch cache.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- `CHANGELOG.md` adopted as the canonical in-repo history, with a matching
  "update the changelog" step and section in `RELEASING.md`.

### Changed

- Full Tailwind CSS migration: every screen and component restyled on shared
  design tokens and utility classes, with a responsive pass across the auth,
  lobby, game, and stats flows.
- Consolidated sprite masking and title effects into shared components.
- Splash logo matched to the app hero and FatPixel preloaded for faster mobile
  load.
- Normalized all source comments to a house standard (INFO/BUG/FIXME/TODO/
  ERROR/WARN prefixes, 80-column, end-aligned) and removed redundant ones.

### Fixed

- Bot winner avatar now uses the correct `.gif` extension.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Standalone About, FAQ, and How-To-Play pages, served as static HTML with a
  shared `seo.css` stylesheet.
- Baseline on-page SEO and an OpenGraph/Twitter link preview.
- A PWA web app manifest (`manifest.webmanifest`) and a `sitemap.xml`.

### Changed

- Static-LCP splash with code-splitting and smoother in-game card flight.
- Favicon switched to `favicon.ico`.
- Replaced the oversized OpenGraph `link_image.png` with a lighter version.
- Asset licensing clarified — CC0 scoped to project work, with a trademark
  disclaimer.

### Fixed

- Corrected inaccurate How-To-Play instructions.
- Errors already handled by their awaiter no longer double-toast.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Host and lobby settings with contract-bound validation, error codes, and a
  structured error envelope (code + detail).
- Env-driven bot timing, a reconnect grace window, and lobby defaults.
- Client-side translation of backend error codes into readable messages.
- SemVer pre-release tag support in `VERSION`, and a `RELEASING.md` guide.

### Changed

- Centralized CSS variables and pixel-corner styling; began the Tailwind
  rollout.
- Data-driven contract generators via `x-constants`; code-based `SendError` and
  a generic `SendSuccess`.

### Fixed

- Host settings clamped to contract bounds on both ends.
- Pixel-perfect rendering and font corrections across the web client.
- Rank colouring applied correctly to tied #1/#2/#3 players.
- Auth inputs given proper autocomplete and name attributes.
- Jollies prompt for a colour rather than a card type.
- Duplicate toasts eliminated.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- Per-card `can_play` flags and the active colour are sent from the server,
  driving Jolly display.

### Changed

- Card model refactor: `color` → `type` across the contract, backend, and
  frontend; integer `Action` enum wired through the protocol.
- The build now reads the version from the `VERSION` file.

### Fixed

- Playable cards and the UNO prompt are now driven by the server `can_play`
  field.
- The `+4` stack penalty is deferred until the colour choice resolves.
- Bot actions broadcast between each step in instant-play mode.
- Kick/promote use `PlayerRef` payloads, and the promote response is awaited.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-18

First tagged release, marking the point where semantic versioning was adopted.
The `VERSION` file becomes the single source of truth, read at build time by
both the backend and the frontend. It captures the full game built up to this
point:

### Added

- A 4-player UNO-like game with a pluggable rule engine: draw-stacking,
  jump-in, 7/0, and no-bluffing rules on top of the standard deck.
- Heuristic, opt-in bots with random names to fill empty seats.
- Lobbies with create, join, and browse flows, host-configurable settings,
  kick/promote, and reconnection handling.
- Account registration, login, and logout over JWT, with avatars.
- A statistics screen with detailed per-player breakdowns, plus saveable and
  resumable matches.
- A C++ uWebSockets backend and a Svelte frontend wired together by an
  AsyncAPI schema-driven contract generated across the stack.
- A pixel-art interface with custom fonts, music, and card/board animations.
- SQLite persistence with WAL journaling for safe online backups.
- SEO metadata, OpenGraph/Twitter cards, a sitemap, and Google Search Console
  verification.
- A multi-stage Docker image published to GHCR via CI, with a standardized
  cross-platform CMake/Conan build.

### Security

- Token-bucket rate limiting for HTTP and WebSocket traffic, login throttling
  with lockout, and per-IP connection caps.
- WebSocket payload-size, idle-time, and backpressure bounds, malformed-frame
  guards, and path-traversal protection on static file serving.
